        <!-- Section One Sculpey -->
        <div class = "brands-second-section">
            <!-- Column One -->
            <div>
                <h3 class = "brands-column-one"> Sculpey Original </h3>
                <p>
                    It is a very soft clay that is easy to work with. 
                    It comes in large quantities with white, terra cotta, and granite colors. 
                    However, its over-softness is its downside, making it mushy and brittle/weak after baking.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class = "brands-column-one"> Sculpey Premo </h3>
                <p>
                    It's a very versatile and a very beloved clay in the Polymer Clay community. 
                    It's easy to condition, not too soft or too hard, and is very flexible/durable after baking. 
                    It has a bunch of nice primary colors that mix pretty well with other colors to get a specific pallete. 
                    It is what most people use, given how efficient its results are. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Column Two -->
            <div>
                <h3 class = "brands-column-two"> Sculpey III</h3>
                <p>
                    It's much stronger than original Sculpey but can be pretty brittle after baking. 
                    It is pretty easy to work with, but is also regarded as too soft, making it hard to make sharp details. 
                    Its biggest advantage is the colors. 
                    It comes in a huge variety of different colors and shades. 
                    You can mix it with stronger clays and still retain the color that you want.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Column Three -->
            <div>
                <h3> Super Sculpey </h3>
                <p> 
                    Also comes in large quantities like Original Sculpey with a light beige color. 
                    It's pretty translucent but darkens after baking. 
                    It bakes pretty hard and firm, which makes it the best for sculptures or dolls. 
                </p>

                <h3> Sculpey Souffle </h3>
                <p>
                    It's a very flexible and strong clay while also being soft and easy to handle. 
                    However, it doesn't have that many bright color options, and mixing different colors can give some unpredictable results. 
                    It is regarded as an all-around solid clay. 
                </p>

            <!-- Column One -->
            <div>
                <h3> Fimo Professional </h3>
                <p>
                    Fimo Professional is also a highly regarded clay like Premo, but is decently hard to condition as it comes a little hard out of the package. 
                    It's pretty easy to work with after conditioning, versatile, and bakes very durable. 
                    Its colors are based on a true primary color palette, making it perfect for being able to mix colors based on color theory to get a specific color. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Column Two -->
            <div>
            <h3> Fimo Soft </h3>
                <p> 
                    As the name suggests, it's pretty easy to work with and strong after baking. 
                    However, its softness can cause problems when making fine details. 
                    It also has a bit of a lower shelf life than other clays. 
                    It also has a bunch of different colors, like Sculpey III.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Column Three -->

            <div>

                    It has an good amount of decent colors. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 class = "brands-column-one"> Pardo Polymer Clay </h3>
                <p>
                    A German brand that has a pretty large spectrum of both regular and shiny colors. 
                    It's soft enough to work with but also firm and a little stiff. 
                    It also has the clearest translucent clays on the market.  
                </p>

                <h3> Papa's Clay </h3>
                <p>
                    More of the newer ones to coming to the polymer clay market. 
                    It's pretty good at holding sharp details, is soft but not mushy, and has a huge range of colors. 
                    However, it does not do well to be conditioning in a pasta machine and instead will have to be warmed up and kneaded in your hands. 
                    There have been changes made to make it condition better with a pasta machine.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Column Two -->
            <div>

                    One of the best translucent clays out there, and it has many different types and colors. 
                    It is pretty easy to condition, but it may end up getting too soft. 
                    It's also strong after baking. 
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Column Three -->

                <h3> CosClay </h3>
                <p>
                    Also, a newer clay that conditions easily due to how soft it is. 
                    It's very rubbery and flexible making it easy to bend. 
                    It has some good colors and skin colors to make clay-dolls. 
                </p>

                <h3> Kato PolyClay </h3>
                <p>
                    Also a clay whose colors are meant to be close to a primary color palette. 
                    Its hard to conditioned and stiff to work with. 
                    But,it's incribily strong and last long making it good for polymer clay techniques like canning. 
                    Though, it has a pretty distinct smell that might turn some people off.
