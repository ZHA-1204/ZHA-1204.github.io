                Baking your clay to harden the pieces is the most imporatant proceess to get right when it comes to working with polymer clay.
                This page is going to talk about all the aspects of baking Polymer Clay so that you can have little to no trouble hardening your pieces.

            <p class = "second-section-descr">
                Baking is a huge part of working with Polymer clay and often is the aspect where things tend to go wrong. 
                If your clay is not conditioned properly or if the clay is too thick, it causes cracks to form in your clay, which is not a nice look on your pieces. 
                Cracking can also form if there are temperature fluctuations in the oven, so pre-heating the oven before putting your pisces in is a must. 
                The most important step to making sure your clay is baked properly is the temperature at which you bake the clay. 
                If your temperature is even a little bit off from the recommended temperature, it may end up causing you problems. 
                If the temperature is too high, the clay will burn. 
                If the temperature is too low, it will cause your clay to be underbaked from the inside, making it more prone to breaking easily. 
                The temperature at which you bake your clay will be specified on the packaging, so I would recommend you not deviate from it. 
                The average temperature to bake your clay is usually around 275 degrees Fahrenheit. 
                The Oven itself, however, can be pretty unreliable in what temperature it shows versus what temperature it actually is. 
                So I emphasize that you invest in an oven thermometer so that you can get the accurate temperature of your oven. 
                Another thing I should mention is the time you put your clay into the oven. 
                Time isn't as much of an issue as the temperature, so people will either put their clay in the oven for 30 minutes up to 2 hours. 
                I usually bake mine for 1 hour to make sure it bakes thoroughly. 
                The recommended time to put your clay in the oven is about 15 to 30 minutes per 1/4 inch of clay thickness.

                The thickness of your clay pieces is an important aspect of clay when it comes to baking your clay in the oven. 
                Polymer Clay sculptures or pieces that are too thin or too thick cause them to break off or crack, ruining your hardwork, especially if that work was for someone else. 
                One way to make sure your clay is not too thick is to use foil inside the clay as a sort of filler. 
                Not only does it give a lightness to your pieces, but it also helps save clay, as buying an abundance can get pretty pricey.
