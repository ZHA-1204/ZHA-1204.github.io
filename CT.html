                Before getting started creating with Polymer clay, there are some things that are need to be talked about in order to make sure that
                sculpting with Polymer Clay goes as smooth as possible.

                    Conditioning is the process of making Polymer Clay more pliable, soft, and moldable. 
                    It is incredibly important pre-prep process for clay, as not conditioning your clay will make it crumbly and brittle, even causing the Clay to break after baking. 
                    You can condition your clay by Hand kneading, rolling, and folding it in your hands until it's soft like play-dough. 
                    Hand-kneading is good for Polymer Clay like Sculpy III, but for harder clays, a Pasta Machine will do a much better job conditioning your clay. 
                    Pasta Machine is an incredibly useful investment if you plan to do a lot of Polymer Clay Sculpting, as it is way better at conditioning your clay than you could ever do alone.

                    While you can sculpt with clay using just your hands, having tools makes sculpting way easier and gives you the ability to sculpt in a way that your hands alone cannot. 
                    There are many different tools that you can use, and there are even tools that are specific to what you are trying to create. 
                    There are some specific tools that I think are a must-have when it comes to Polymer clay. First, some kind of knife or blade is very useful for cutting off pieces of your clay. 
                    Doting tools are also very useful for not only making indents but also attaching different pisces of your clay. 
                    A needle tool is also a must-have when making designs in your clay. If you plan to make a lot of Jewelry, clay cutters are good for making neat shapes. 
                    An acrylic roller to roll out your clay to make those neat shapes is also a must. 
                    I also recommend creating on a clean, really smooth surface, as clay will tend to stick to the bottom of what you're trying to create.

            <p class = "second-section-descr tips-style">
                If you've worked with clay before, you have had a big problem with getting little pieces of hair and dust in your clay, no matter how clean you keep your workspace. 
                A way to keep your clay looking nice and clean is to take a Q-tip with alcohol on it and carefully clean the area with the hair or dust. 
                Make sure not to add too much alcohol onto your clay, as it causes extra alcohol to be absorbed and detach pieces from each other.
            </p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <p class = "second-section-descr tips-style-two"> Often time when attaching different pieces of clay, the pisces tend to come off, which is incredibly annoying to glue the pieces back together. 
                You can use liquid Sculpey or liquid polymer clay to act as a glue between the pisces before you bake them. 
                The liquid polymer clay will harden in the oven and make the pieces incredibly strong and resilient.
