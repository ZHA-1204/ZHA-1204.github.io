                With the vast amount of possibilities of things you could create with Polymer Clay, sometimes it hard to pick something to start with. 
                Sometimes you have not even a single idea on what you want to create, so here I've decided to share some ideas on projects that you or may not want to tackle.

                <P class = "project-descrp-two">
                    Some of my favorite things to create are a bunch of differnet earrings and necklaces to wear throughout the day. 
                    The advantage of making your own jewelry is being able to customize it to your own choice which is pretty handy with you have specific style preferences.

                    There are so many different little figurines you could make from your favorite charcaters or your favorite animals. 
                    Ecpecially if there are certain characters figurines that are pretty hard to find on the market.

                <p class = "project-descrp">
                    I've seen a lot of pretty clay bookmarks being sold on Etsy as a late and might be a fun project for book readers all around. 
                    Book readers might especially enjoy this project as having the ability to have custom bookmarks for youe favorite books.

                <p class = "project-descrp">
                    Maybe you might want to give your keys some personality, Polymer Clay keychains are defintly the way to go to add a little more to an everday boring object.
                    Keychians also not need to only be for keys as they can be added to customize your bags.
