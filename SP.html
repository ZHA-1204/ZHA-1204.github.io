                Honestly, I don't really sand/buff my pieces or even know too many techniques on it, but as you go into more professional work, Sanding and Buffing becomes a pretty useful process to make your pieces like neat and professional. 
                It's the process of removing imperfections and fingerprints in your clay pisces after baking to make the clay look neater and give your clay some more shine. 
                It's process that you achieve with water and sandpaper. 
                If you want to know a more in-depth process of Sanding and Buffing, this website here does a great job at it: <a href = "https://www.rokolee.com/sand-buff-finish-polymer-clay" > How To Sand, Buff + Finish Polymer Clay </a>

                A question amongst beginners asked is always on the ability to be able to paint on your Polymer Clay pisces, which, the answer to that question is indeed yes. 
                You can paint on polymer clay mostly the same way that you paint on anything, and it can give you many more customization options with more specific detailing that you may not be able to get with just clay alone. 
                People have even gone a step deeper and added paint to polymer clay before the clay is baked with specialized techniques. 
                One good upside with painting on polymer clay is that if you mess up or make a mistake, you can easily wipe the paint off with a little bit of water, as polymer clay is, most of the time, water-resistant.  
                Another thing to mention that is not related to paint is that you are also able to give your clay pisces some shine with mica powder, which is applied before the clay is baked. 
                There are a lot of ways and techniques to customize your clay projects.

            <h2 class = "section-titles"> Sealing </h2>
            <p class = "second-section-descr">
                While Polymer Clay pisces don't usually need a top coat or sealant, there are some occasions where maybe you might want your clay look nice and glossy. 
                Also, if you are going to paint on your clay, a sealer is a must, like any other painted item, as the paint will come off over time with no protection. 
                Several different ways and sealers can be used to get a nice finish with things like varnish, wax, liquid polymer clay, and resin being some of the more well-known ones. 
                Whenever you're scrolling through Pinterest or looking at polymer clay projects online, most of the time the pisces are sealed with resin, which is probably the most commonly used type of polymer clay sealer.
                Resin in itself is a whole art form and has a lot of different steps/information to it, so I would recommend searching specifically on how to work with resin. 
                I also want to mention that when working with resin, please make sure to use the correct safety precautions, as dealing with resin improperly can cause long-term damage to your health.
