                    The art of creating with clay has gone back through <i> many </i>generation of people. 
                    Clay is an incredibly verstile piece of earth that has been used to create an assortment of different things with the most known being things plates or mugs.
                    Now a days, there have been many different clay mediums come out to choose from when starting to create.

                    Polymer clay is a man-made oven baked modeling material made up of a polyninyl chloride (PVC) and resin base. 
                    It is soft, does not dry out easily and comes in the variety of differnet colors and textures like glitter or metalics. 
                    Diffrent colors or textures can also easily be mixed together to add more customization to your projects.

                    The early 1990s called for a high demand for synthetic alternatives to replace already limited natural compounds like shellac, which gave rise to a plastic-based compound called Polymer. 
                    While Polymer was not initially meant to become clay, it was recognized as a versatile moldable material that can be used to create many different things, especially because it can stay soft and harden with heat. 
                    Polymer Clay was then born as it today.
